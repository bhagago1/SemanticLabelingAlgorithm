Eakins very likely hoped that his grand portrait would be acquired by the university to hang with her donation.

"","","Homer's painting cleverly refers to the rising American temperance movement, a crusade against drinking alcohol, by depicting a stout milkmaid pausing while a farmhand drinks from her ladle. Swaying under the weight of her pail and squinting into the sun, she presents the ideal of natural womanhood. Her powerful presence, marked by broad shoulders, muscular arms, and sunburned skin, counters the farmhand's relaxed stance and shaded face, visually reversing traditional gender roles. Far from flirting, the two figures awkwardly avoid each other's gaze, modeling rural wholesomeness and rectitude.","Made in United States, North and Central America","A Temperance Meeting","http://www.philamuseum.org/images/cad/large/1956-118-1-CX.jpg","1874","","","20 3/8 x 30 1/8 inches (51.8 x 76.5 cm)","","Oil on canvas","","","","American","","Winslow Homer","Purchased with the John Howard McFadden, Jr., Fund, 1956"

"","","Renowned artist Winslow Homer was an avid sportsman and his outdoor subjects reflect an unsentimental view of the conflict between man and nature. In this scene set in the Adirondack region of New York State, earthen colors link the hunter and the environment, making it difficult to distinguish the man from the hill behind him. Homer visited the Adirondacks as one of many vacationers who flocked there in the late nineteenth century. The huntsman in Homers painting is not a visitor but rather a local trapper or guide who has caught a deer and is carrying off its pelt, antlers, and, likely, a pack full of meat.","Made in United States, North and Central America","A Huntsman and Dogs","http://www.philamuseum.org/images/cad/large/E1924-3-8-CX.jpg","1891","","","28 1/8 x 48 inches (71.4 x 121.9 cm)

"","","The figures in this meticulously executed scene respond with a variety of emotions to a plan by Petruchio to subdue his argumentative new wife. Proclaiming that her new dress is not good enough, he threatens the tailor. Katharina's atypical composure suggests Petruchio's success in ""taming"" her temper. Best known for biblical history pictures, romantic portraits, and landscapes, Allston was also a poet and novelist. His interest in Shakespeare undoubtedly was stimulated by his close friendship with Shakespearean scholar Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

"","","American Rockingham wares were popular in the Unites States from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries. The term ""Rockingham"" derives from an English factory on the estate of the Marquess of Rockingham that produced ceramic objects from 1745 until 1842. The factory became known for its mottled manganese-brown glazes and for its relief-molded decorations, often in the revived Rococo style (characterized by the use of leaf and flower motifs, curves and sinuous lines, and organic forms).

"","","A resident of Yazoo City, Mississippi, Pearlie Posey used templates made by her daughter, Sarah Mary Taylor, for her own appliqu quilts and, because of failing eyesight, relied on her to cut out the shapes. She liked to mix the figures in each block and connect them with strips of colorful fabric. Posey traced the gymnasts on this quilt from a pantyhose advertisement; she copied the central figure in a coat from another advertisement. She learned to quilt from her grandmother, a former slave, and continued to quilt throughout her life. She remembered that during her childhood piecing and quilting were community activities. Families would get together to tear up old clothes and overalls for quilt tops and on Sunday mornings the women would gather at one house to quilt.","Made in United States, North and Central America","""Exercisers"" Quilt","http://www.philamuseum.org/images/cad/large/2006-163-6-pma.jpg","1981","","","79 1/2 x 64 3/4 inches (201.9 x 164.5 cm)","","Cotton and polyester; running stitch","","","","American","","Pearlie Posey","The Ella King Torrey Collection of African American Quilts, 2006"
