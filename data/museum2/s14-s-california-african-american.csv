Fifteen years earlier Fitzgerald had had great success with her Cole Porter Songbook and this date, even with a few hokey arrangements, almost reaches the same level. Trumpeter Harry ""Sweets"" Edison and pianist Tommy Flanagan are among the supporting cast. Highlights include ""I Get a Kick out of You, I've Got You Under My Skin, All of You, My Heart Belongs to Daddy and Just One of Those Things."" --Scott Yanow","","Dream Dancing [test pressing]","http://trio.caamuseum.org/image.asp?media=%5C%5Ccaamapp1%5Ctrioimages%5CElla+Fitzgerald%5C19995%2E13%2E11e%2Ejpg","","Diameter: 12""","","vinyl LP record, paper album sleeve, plastic cover","","African American","","Ella Fitzgerald","Museum purchase"
