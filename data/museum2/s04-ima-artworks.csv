            Although Hopper is best known for his views of New York interiors and buildings, he also painted landscapes
            that capture the starkness of rural New England.
            Devoid of people, Hopper’s landscapes have an abandoned atmosphere that echoes the loneliness and isolation
            of his urban scenes.
            This canvas, named after the East Coast railroad line, was painted during the Depression and depicts a
            landscape and desolate house along the railroad tracks. The prominence of the tracks suggests Hopper’s
            recurring theme of transience and the solitude of the traveler.

             Learn More
            Debt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life.  Born in
            North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took
            him to Scotland, but his mentor’s death forced Stuart back to America.  During the Revolutionary War, he
            returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West.  As success came, so did debt which
            forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded
            portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using
            any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important
            political figures.  One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the “Athenaeum Head” currently
            on the dollar bill.
            In this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British
            portraiture.  The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boy’s
            jacket move the viewer’s eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures. The woman is wearing a simple,
            elegant, robe à l’anglaise, a gown favored by portrait painters of the period.  The woman’s hair is lightly
            powdered and fashionably styled in the coiffure à l'hérisson, or “hedgehog,” in which the hair was cut short
            in the front, frizzed to the ends and then brushed up away from the face.

            During the late 1880s Reid followed his Boston classmates Frank Benson and Edmund Tarbell to Paris for study
            at the Académie Julian. While Benson and Tarbell began exploring Impressionist ideas in France, Reid only
            fell under the style’s influence after returning to the US in 1889.
            Best known for murals painted in a decorative style, Reid displayed an Impressionist point of view in easel
            paintings like this portrait of his wife. He also created stained-glass windows, another indication of his
            attraction to the effects of sunlight.

        ","In this portrait Eaton's brushstrokes appear loose, but the drawing of the sitter's facial
            features remains firm and solid.
            Eaton spent only a short time in Indianapolis, during which he studied under Jacob Cox.  He eventually
            settled in New York.
            The artist developed a reputation as a skillful painter of women's portraits.
