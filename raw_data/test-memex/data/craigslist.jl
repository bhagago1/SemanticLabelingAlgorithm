For years the most brilliant computer technicians tried to figure out how to create fraud proof digital money, Digital money that could not be counterfeited. In 2009 a group of people (or maybe one individual we still do not know) who to this day remain anonymous by the name Satoshi Nakamoto released a technology now referred to as the Blockchain. They suggested it solved the challenge of digital money that could not be counterfeited. Digital money that could be trusted. They claimed it could not get hacked, and it could not be counterfeited. What they introduced was Bitcoin using a new technology concept we call BlockChain. A running decentralized ledger that exist not in one place but in thousands of places simultaneously. The tech community tried to hack it and they tried in every way to prove them wrong but could not, and the future of money was born. The value of BitCoin in 2009 was just a penny or so and the awareness of this new form of money among other things started to grow in the high tech community. 7 years later the world is starting to take notice and it is only going to go faster from here. There were countless of people who became millionaires and saw Bitcoin value reach over $1000 per coin and then settled around $400 Still many people have no idea how it works or what it really is.

And even though BitCoin has come a long way and is still the leader another company is exploding in numbers and will soon be overtaking BitCoin. The founder understood the flaws in BitCoin before anyone else and has corrected them and launched what will soon become a contender to replace dollar as the world reserve currency.
