Here is the exact description when I bought it. Smith  Wesson Model 28-2 .357 Highway Patrolman thats been improved over factory. This revolver wears the 4  pinned  barrel and has the  recessed (counter-bored) chambers. This revolver received an action job by Teddy Jacobson (Actions by T) and is marked with his logo on the right side of the frame. Jacobsons crane ball lock has also been installed to help keep things tight and the trigger face has been smoothed. Overall condition is excellent with about 97-98% finish remaining. There are a few minor handling marks and the usual cylinder turn line, but no rust or any pitting. The custom grips are reminiscent of the old SW diamond Magnas, but the are actually ebony wood and there is a grip adapter installed for a vintage look and improved purchase. Over 450.00 in custom work. The mechanics are in good working order and both timing and lock-up are excellent. The bore is likewise in excellent shape with bright/sharp rifling, this Smith was manufactured in about 1971. Meet in Loganville, Grayson, Monroe, Walnut Grove or Covington. Trades, maybe....colt 1911, other smith and Wessons. HERE THE LINK to TEDDYs website:       http://www.actionsbyt.com", "Atlanta0033": "", "trade1645": "2015", "Name0846": ""}
