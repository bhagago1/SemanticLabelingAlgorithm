It comes with the complete AA kit plus the full BCG and a pistol length drive rod, the ID of the gas block is .750\"    This design of this piston system is just incredible, especially when shot suppressed. It has 5 different gas settings for numerous applications (ie, subsonic) and is unique in that it can fit under most handguards that use a standard barrel nut, instead of having the block poking up in front of the handguard and disrupting the profile. It also is legitimately self-cleaning, and designed to shoot around 10,000 rounds before requiring to be cleaned. These kits are for a mid-length setup, but pistol, carbine and rifle length drive rods can be purchased separately from Adams Arms to fit whatever length is required.

Adjustable gas settings for various applications.  Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and super sonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppresses fire.
